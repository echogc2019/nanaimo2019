              <p class="ew-intro_a">
                I grew up in China and went to Canada for the Master of Business Administration program at the University of Ottawa in my early 20s.
              </p>


              <p class="ew-intro_a">
                When I was in high school in China, I was preparing for the University entrance exam under incredible pressure. I just lost my grandma due to a car accident, and my mom was hospitalized, waiting for surgery. I had constant fever for several months, and the doctor thought that I had lymphoma. That was the most challenging and painful experience so far at that time. I was hopeless but fortunately could not find a reason to kill myself. That is why I am here today. If you are in desperation today, don’t give up. The darkest hour is the one before dawn.
              </p>

              <p class="ew-intro_a">
                I married my husband and raised three kids in the french community of the national capital region. All my kids attend french school and are fluent in both official languages. I speak fluent English, Cantonese and Mandarin.
               </p>

               <p class="ew-intro_a">
                Right after the MBA program, I started several online businesses. Later I also had opportunities working in the federal government and crown corporation.  The highlight of my career is a member of the Team Canada Trade Mission to promote big projects overseas for Canada.
               </p>

               <p class="ew-intro_a">
                I was saved by Jesus Christ when I was studying MBA program, my core values are shaped by my Christian faith. I am a loving person and welcoming to people from all backgrounds.
               </p>

               <p class="ew-intro_a">
                I had a calling from God about three years ago to move our family to Nanaimo because there will be a big revival in Nanaimo. Seven months later we moved to Nanaimo as we want to be part of the revival. Nanaimo people are welcoming, talented and creative, our whole family fell in love with the beautiful harbour city.

              Why are you running to be Nanaimo-Ladysmith’s MP?
              <div class="divider-space"></div>
              <p class="ew-intro_a">
                I see, hear and experience many concerns, frustrations and pain about health care, education, housing, drug, homeless, and the situation of First Nations people. But we lack a voice in Ottawa to represent our concerns, as the political parties put their interest above ours.
              </p>


                <p class="ew-intro_a">
                I never planned to be a politician, and may not be a politician in the future. However, I have a strong calling to represent and promote our beautiful region. It is completely unacceptable to keep the status quo.
                </p>

                <p class="ew-intro_a">
                As a visible minority myself, I believe diversity is a strength. I respect and appreciate the difference in the communities. I always enjoy working as a bridge to bring people from different backgrounds together.  I am a great communicator and negotiator, passionately achieve win-win solutions in conflicting situations.
                </p>

                <p class="ew-intro_a">
                In this campaign, I am going to call for a movement to invite all Canadians to support the independent candidates in Canada so that their voices are heard in Parliament and are not suppressed by the political party interests. Our website will be: http://echomyvoice.ca/.

              What are your priorities for the riding and if elected, how will you work in Parliament for your constituents?
              <div class="divider-space"></div>
              <p class="ew-intro_a">
                My vision and mission for Nanaimo-Ladysmith are to transform the region into an innovation centre of Canada. I will work closely with the First Nations community, municipal, provincial, federal governments and Vancouver Island University.
              </p>
                <p class="ew-intro_a">
                    I believe this election will result in a fragmented parliament. As an independent MP, I will have great negotiation power for my riding. I will work with other MPs and parties on a case-by-case base to maximize the benefit to my people, such as more tax incentives, government grants, training program and R&D investments.
                </p>

                <p class="ew-intro_a">
                    Once elected, I will start develope a voting system for Nanaimo-Ladysmith residents to collect your responses on major issues and echo it to the Parliament. I will passionately and tirelessly voice your concerns in Parliament as an independent MP.
